DashClockSMSViewer
==================

View SMS message contents in DashClock

I've been a fan of DashClock for a long time. But one thing that always seemed misssing
about it was that the SMS extension built into it didn't show the contents of the messages
you have received. I thought that this couldn't be too hard, and it wasn't.

I grabbed the DashClock SMS extension source and modified it to display the sender in the top part,
and the message text in the bottom part, unless there are more than one senders, in which case it'll
display a '# unread conversations.'

Big thanks to ShortFuse for helping me with the version 0.2 stuff!
